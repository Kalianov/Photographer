        <B> Andreas Gursky look at the world</B> - is the sight of an alien who has a perfect vision and be able to see something that is not available to the ordinary human eye. This photographer with the camera saw the post-industrial society as a body working in perfect rhythm .
        This new look and new style master brought international recognition and made ​​it the most expensive photograph in the world.<br><br>

        <B>Photographer works </B>- majestic in conception and monumental in execution - not even hit some very human pathos. Some German critics say that Gursky more interested in space and the universe , what, in fact , a man .<br><br>

        But Gursky not rather be called a philosopher, stared at the starry sky overhead , and a singer of globalization. Photographer monumental canvases sing a new wonderful world - modern Asian cities with their skyscrapers , large-scale production , sports, collecting tens of thousands of spectators.<br><br>

        Photo perspektivaAndreas Gursky in his youth did not know that would be the millionaire photographer , whose work will be included in the story , and the cost will break all records in the history of photography . Young Gursky wanted to do photography for fun , following in the footsteps of his family. His father, grandfather and both were photographers.<br><br>

        Photographer born in 1955 in Leipzig (GDR) When he was two years old, his family moved to West Germany. In the 50s it was still possible. Changing several places of residence , the family settled in Dusseldorf Gursky , where his father Andreas was soon able to realize itself as a fashion advertising photographer .<br><br>

        Azam photos Andreas learned from his father , and after graduation he continued his education in Essen - Folkwang School - where I studied many famous professional photographers . After completing his studies, young Andreas tried to find a job, but nothing interesting he did not offer , and work as a photographer of the newspaper ( where he worked for three days ) seemed to him uninteresting.<br><br>

        <B>- In the 70 years of the last century, photography has not been considered an art, at least in Germany. In other words, those who are interested in photography these years , could not hope to succeed in the art world - recalled Gursky . - So I decided to continue their education , instead of being a craftsman .</B><br><br>

        In 1981, Andreas Gursky became a student of the State Academy of Arts in Dusseldorf. Considerable influence on the style of the photographer had his teacher - Hilla Becher and Brandt - Master of Conceptualism , made ​​famous by taking a series of industrial facilities. Almost all pupils achieved international recognition Becher .<br><br>

        <B> - When I began to study, I decided to start shooting architecture. Only after a while I began to take pictures in the Ruhr Valley . I sought to capture not only the landscape and the people in it , how to find a new style - says Gursky .</B><br><br>

        Photo perspektivaUzhe in his early works felt detachment desire to observe the distance between himself and the man who got into the frame. Gursky confessed that he did not just reject shots where people were looking at the camera or posing . The man in the pictures the photographer performs more functional role , it is anonymous and devoid of personality.<br><br>

        In the 80's and 90 's of last century, the photographer took industrial theme. Aesthetics industrial complexes gave impetus to the development of its independent author's style , which clearly felt the desire to detail and monumentality .<br><br>

        With each passing year , and grew out of his work. Already in the late 80's photographer used the largest size paper that existed at that time . Then he started to glue together several sheets until it reached a format that it uses today. On average, his photographs are as big as 2 to 4 meters.<br><br>

        Andreas Gursky pretty early on that can not be limited to a particular theme. He began to travel around the world and visited all the major cities of the globe. Moreover, it was not interested in architectural landmarks , panoramic photography or aerial photography wonders of nature itself . Gursky attract objects that meet its author's intention . He can come up with a picture , and then find a suitable object .<br><br>

        Gursky first gained international recognition thanks to the work «Untitled V» - photos , which depicts a giant shelf with sneakers . The picture was sold for <B>611</B> thousand <B>229</B> dollars.<br><br>

        <B>- I believe that these pictures tell us something important about the state of our society. In this photo palpable obsession with consumerism - says German photographer .</B><br><br>

        Photographer prefers to search and remove duplicate fragments, which he likes to put in abstract patterns . Fragments of stunning clarity , with crisp details and equally near and in the distance.<br><br>

        The artist looks at the world with a certain distance . He often takes a bird's-eye : a helicopter or a tower crane. But the point of view it is difficult to find , as the photographer often uses the combined shooting.<br><br>

        Andreas Gursky actively using modern computer technology. It combines two or three shots to create a large-scale canvas . That's why the picture is often impossible to find the point of view (there may be two or three , such as the photograph " Tour de France "). He treats his work carefully , removing shadows, increasing or decreasing the objects or even removing them . For example, the photograph "Rhine II», with the background image disappeared numerous industrial facilities. The resulting landscape never existed in nature, but it did not worry any author's work , nor the organizers of the auction, which was put up for auction "Rhine II». As a result, a monumental painting was sold for an unprecedented amount in the history of 4 , $ 4 million.<br><br>

        All critics claim that he is abusing computer technology, Gursky usually responds : " I ​​strive to create a work of art that must be distinguished from nature - I did not do a realistic picture ."<br><br>

        Photo perspektivaV works Gursky no place individuality. People are indistinguishable from their own kind , merging into the mainstream . Only considering the full size photos - you can see their faces . But Gursky prefers to shoot people with covered faces : Team athletes helmeted workers in protective masks or hide among the many human parts.<br><br>

        The picture shows the Japanese neutrino detector (Kamiokande, 2007), where 11 thousand gold photoelectrons and 50,000 tons of water creates a fantastic picture , not easy to see the two scientists who are inside a huge device.<br><br>

        <B>Photo prospects feel somehow fixing device , expressing in his own zeitgeist - says Gursky .</B><br><br>

        Gursky was the first to photograph the human society as a huge well -organized structure . He captures fragments of post-industrial life rather detached. His look intimidating , as there are no ordinary human emotions. At the same time, we must pay tribute to Gursky - the first picture shows a clear clarity of details in such a large masshatabe . The quality is not inferior to serious painting , and is probably why most of Gursky called art paintings and not photographs.<br><br>

        Photo perspektivaStremlenie turn everyday images of ordinary objects into works of art have in common with his father Andreas Gursky pop art of Andy Warhol. Like Warhol , Gursky has its own unique color vision of the world, tends to put similar fragments in the composite pattern , and finally - the photographer is able to take millions of images of banal things. Critics do not cease still argue : who are these two masters - lucky dealers or geniuses of art?<br><br>

        <B>- Although Gursky photographer, but in the art world has long seen his name on a par with the artists . That's why he broke a price ceiling in the photo. When he sold his work to one hundred thousand dollars, it seemed to me that they can only buy crazy . Now the price of a few million does not seem strange to me , - says Andrew Renton , art consultant photographer.</B><br><br>

        The most expensive photograph in the world still lives and works in Düsseldorf. His photographs are honored to acquire leading art centers of the world . Also private collections, the exhibition of Gursky joined Museum of Modern Art (New York ), the Centre Pompidou , the National Gallery.<br><br>
